## Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using anomaly detection techniques. The approach involves data preprocessing, feature encoding, and the application of Isolation Forest to identify anomalies. Additionally, t-SNE visualization is used to gain insights into fraudulent patterns within the dataset.

**Key Features:**

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical data.
Anomaly Detection Model: Implementation of Isolation Forest to identify fraudulent transactions.
Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization: Using t-SNE to analyze and interpret patterns in fraudulent activities.
Performance Evaluation: Model tuning and validation to optimize fraud detection accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning (Isolation Forest, t-SNE)

This project demonstrates how anomaly detection techniques can enhance fraud detection in financial transactions, improving security and mitigating risks.
